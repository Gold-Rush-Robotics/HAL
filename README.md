# HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

The **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** is responsible for enabling communication between the robot's hardware and higher-level software systems. This layer interacts directly with sensors, motors, and servos, providing a standardized interface for other layers to interact with hardware components.

## Goal üèÜÔ∏è

The goal of this project is to create a flexible and reusable hardware abstraction system that can be used current and future GRR robots with minimal changes. By standardizing how hardware is accessed and controlled, the HAL will simplify future development and integration with new components.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The HAL module provides:

- **Sensor Interfaces**: Functions to read data from various sensors such as cameras, distance sensors, and more.
- **Motor/Servo Control**: Functions to control movement by sending commands to motors and servos.
- **Abstracted Hardware Control**: Abstracting the specific hardware details to simplify the process for the rest of the system.

This repository will contain code to interface with the physical hardware and handle low-level control of robot components.
